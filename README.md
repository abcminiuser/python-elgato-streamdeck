# Python Elgato Stream Deck Library

![Example Deck](ExampleDeck.jpg)

This is an open source Python 3 library to control an
[Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) directly,
without the official software. This can allow you to create your own custom
front-ends, such as a custom control front-end for home automation software.

## Credits:

I've used the reverse engineering notes from
[this GitHub](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/blob/master/NOTES.md)
repository to implement this library. Thanks Alex Van Camp!

Initial StreamDeck Mini support added by [Aetherdyne](https://github.com/Aetherdyne).

## Status:

Working - you can enumerate devices, set the brightness of the panel(s), set
the images shown on each button, and read the current button states.

Currently the following StreamDeck product variants are supported:
* StreamDeck Classic
* StreamDeck Mini
* StreamDeck XL

## Dependencies:

The library core has no special dependencies, but does use one of (potentially)
several HID backend libraries. You will need to install the dependencies
appropriate to your chosen backend.

The included example requires the PIL fork "Pillow", although it can be swapped
out if desired by the user application for any other image manipulation library.

To install all library dependencies at once, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### HIDAPI Backend

The default backend is the HIDAPI Python library, which should work across
the three major (Windows, Mac, Linux) OSes.

## Package Installation:

Install the library via pip:

```
pip install streamdeck
```

Alternatively, manually clone the project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck.git
```

## Raspberry Pi Installation:

The following script has been verified working on a Raspberry Pi (Model 2 B)
running a stock Debian Stretch image, to install all the required dependencies
needed by this project:

```
# Ensure system is up to date, upgrade all out of date packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y

# Install the pip Python package manager
sudo apt install -y python3-pip

# Install system packages needed for the Python hidapi package installation
sudo apt install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

# Install dependencies
pip3 install hidapi

# Add udev rule to allow all users non-root access to Elgato StreamDeck devices:
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/10-streamdeck.rules << EOF
	SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", GROUP="users"
	EOF

# Install the latest version of the StreamDeck library via pip
pip3 install streamdeck

# Alternatively, install git and check out the repository
#sudo apt install -y git
#git clone https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck.git
```

Note that after adding the `udev` rule, a restart will be required in order for
it to take effect and allow access to the StreamDeck device without requiring
root privileges.
