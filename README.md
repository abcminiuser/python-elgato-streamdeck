# Python Elgato Stream Deck Library

![Example Deck](ExampleDeck.jpg)

This is an open source Python 3 library to control an
[Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) directly,
without the official software. This can allow you to create your own custom
front-ends, such as a custom control front-end for home automation software.

Protocol documentation for various StreamDeck products are
[published the Elgato website](https://docs.elgato.com/streamdeck).
